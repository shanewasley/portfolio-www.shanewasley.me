## As a designer

I'm skilled in UI and interaction design, prototyping, qualitative research methods, and workshop facilitation. I lead design projects that deliver quick insights and actionable recommendations. I help leaders refine and communicate their product vision to their organizations. I probe and challenge assumptions with one thing in mind: cultivating the best work from my team so we can deliver the best results for our users.

## How I got here

Back when I worked at [Yammer](https://www.yammer.com), and then [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), I was designing analytics and reporting systems with my eye solely on the business. Then one day, I had the good fortune to be invited to a user research meeting. It was my first introduction to UX and designing with the user front of mind. I was hooked.

Since 2015 I have been fortunate for experiences that helped me grow as a product designer, a UX designer, a service designer, and a researcher working for many organizations.

My work at [Turner Construction](https://www.turnerconstruction.com) and [SKUR Inc.](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/skur) challenged me to design products in 3D and improvise with new methods and design tools.

My work with [Stamen](https://stamen.com/), [USCF Osher Center](https://osher.ucsf.edu/), [Palo Alto University](https://www.paloaltou.edu/), and [Paul Ekman LLC](https://www.paulekman.com/), helped me develop personally as I helped them design products for emotional intelligence.

I honed my service design and user research skills when I worked with [Mandel Communications](https://www.mandel.com/), [Be Great LLC](https://begreatllc.com), and [Claude Stein](https://claudestein.com/) to create new offerings in communication and leadership training.

And most recently, my work for [Flipcause](https://www.flipcause.com) rallied all of my previous experience together as I helped influence the product vision and direction and mentored junior designers. The opportunity to use my talents to give back to an underserved but vital sector in our society has been gratifying.

## When I'm not designing

When I’m not designing, I’m doing the other things I love: West African dancing, cooking, hitting the gym, and working on my EP. I also maintain a hypnotherapy and spiritual counseling practice.

For music I oscillate up to the energy of punk/rock and techno (e.g. [QOTSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRRPeOBygG8), [HÖR Berlin](https://www.youtube.com/c/HÖRBERLIN/videos)), and wind down to jazz/blues (e.g. [Orice Jenkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRBnQ35CcgM), [Eva Cassidy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-X1g-aEeNc), [Sam Cooke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58gDMjDbc8)). My favorite diva is still [Solange](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W14wK4QGh4).

On the internet I'm frequently browsing Hacker News [articles](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28942189), scouring Reddit for non-bot product reviews, and spending time in forums and Discord servers. I love looking at pictures of [space](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190731.html) or pictures of [Earth](https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/Collections/EarthArt/all.htm) from space.

I currently live in San Carlos, CA, and my happy place during the pandemic has been the beach and jumping into the cold waters of the Pacific!
