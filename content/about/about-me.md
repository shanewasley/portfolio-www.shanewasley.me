## As a designer today

I'm skilled in UI and interaction design, prototyping, qualitative research methods, and workshop facilitation. I lead design projects that deliver quick insights and actionable recommendations. I help leaders refine and communicate their product vision to their organizations. I ask tough questions and challenge assumptions with one thing in mind: cultivating excellent work from myself and my team.

## How I got here

Back when I worked at [Yammer](https://www.yammer.com), and then [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), I was designing analytics and reporting systems with my eye solely on the business. Then one day, I had the good fortune to be invited to a user research meeting. It was my first introduction to UX and designing with the user front of mind. I was hooked.

Since 2015 I have been fortunate to have learned many lessons as a product designer, a UX designer, a service designer, and a researcher for many organizations. To name a few:

My work at [Turner Construction](https://www.turnerconstruction.com) and [SKUR Inc.](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/skur) challenged me to design products in 3D and improvise with new methods and design tools.

My work with [Stamen](https://stamen.com/), [USCF Osher Center](https://osher.ucsf.edu/), [Palo Alto University](https://www.paloaltou.edu/), and [Paul Ekman LLC](https://www.paulekman.com/), helped me develop personally as I helped them design products for emotional intelligence.

I honed my service design and user research skills when I worked with [Mandel Communications](https://www.mandel.com/), [Be Great LLC](https://begreatllc.com), and [Claude Stein](https://claudestein.com/) to create new offerings in communication and leadership training.

Most recent work as a designer for [Flipcause](https://www.flipcause.com) has helped me develop my ability to influence an organization’s product vision and direction and mentor junior designers. The opportunity to use my talents to give back to an underserved but vital sector in our society has been gratifying.

## When I'm not designing

When I’m not designing, I’m doing the other things I love: West African dancing, acting classes, cooking, exercise, and working on my first album. I also maintain a hypnotherapy and spiritual counseling practice.

For music I oscillate up to the energy of punk, pop and techno (e.g. [The Ramones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTdbn5t3xH4), [Sia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKSRyLdjsPA), [Disclosure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nsKDJlpUbA), [Chlär](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcaiiDMKipU&t=1742s)), and wind down to the sounds of jazz and blues (e.g. [Eva Cassidy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rd8VktT8xY), [Chuck Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOOmTHwx40), [B.B. King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpC69qIe02E)). I'm more team [Solange](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W14wK4QGh4) than team Beyonce.

Except for browsing Hacker News [articles](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28942189), I'm taking a break from social media. If I have free time to spend on the internet, I'm often looking at [images](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap141001.html) from the Hubble Space Telescope, or browsing art [collections](https://www.artic.edu/artists/35282/paul-klee).

I currently live in San Jose, CA, and my happy place during the pandemic has been [Pescadero State Beach](https://goo.gl/maps/gAhBwpTTyGJxG8G37) and jumping in the cold waters of the Pacific.
