## Summary

SKUR Inc. created a web app for high-fidelity visual analysis of construction sites. By showing how laser surface scans of buildings differed from their 3D design specifications, SKURâ€™s app helped customers identify problems that could increase project delays and costs if they went unaddressed. As SKUR's UI/UX designer, I helped design new product features and improve the user experience for customers. This case study will highlight the team effort to transform a service into a new product feature that would save customers time.
