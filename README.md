# Portfolio site for my design work

This is the repo for my design portfolio website, www.shanewasley.me. Most of my work is NDA'd, but what I can share so far is up online. 

After looking at lots of static site gen options, I decided on Netlify and Hugo. I used the Hugo Papermod theme as my starting point and made changes to the theme's colors, spacing, typography to suit my tastes. I also added in a few shortcodes for looping videos and webp image formats.

I'm happy with the results and I'm seeing 100's across the board on lighthouse.

In 2022 I intend to start blogging and more side-projects to the site.
